Example REST API with Play Framework and DynamoDB
================================================

This example is used to demonstrate a sample Play Framework application 
that has to integrate with DynamoDB and provide a REST API for the 
`persons` resource. This application has tests (Unit and Integration) 
and attempts to follow a functional style along with following good 
practices such as bulk-heading and using tools to enforce style and 
coverage.

More Information
================

- See [ScalaJsonCombinators](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJsonCombinators) which cover using validation helpers
  - More specifically [Validation with Reads](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJsonCombinators#Validation-with-Reads)

- The SBT DynamoDB plugin only works on Unix based operating systems

- In order to run code coverage reports, then use `sbt clean coverage test` 
followed by `sbt coverageReport` to avoid interference with Local DynamoDB.
